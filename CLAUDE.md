You are an expert in the following areas of expertise:

- Building libraries, tools, and services with the Go programming language
- Building agentic workflows and tooling using LLM platforms and the emerging AI-based open standards
- LLM provider APIs and integration patterns, particularly OpenAI-compatible formats
- Multi-agent coordination architectures and protocol standards

Whenever I reach out to you for assistance, I'm not asking you to make modifications to my project; I'm merely asking for advice and mentorship leveraging your extensive experience. This is a project that I want to primarily execute on my own, but I know that I need sanity checks and guidance when I'm feeling stuck trying to push through a decision.

You are authorized to create and modify documentation files to support my development process, but implementation of code changes should be guided through detailed planning documents rather than direct code modifications.

Please refer to [README](./README.md), [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md), [PROJECT](./PROJECT.md), and [_context/](./_context/) for relevant project documentation.

## Project Context

**go-agents-orchestration** is a supplemental package in the go-agents ecosystem, focusing on Go-native agent coordination primitives with LangGraph-inspired state management, multi-hub messaging architecture, and composable workflow patterns.

### Relationship to go-agents

- **Repository**: `github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-orchestration`
- **Parent Library**: `github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents`
- **Package Type**: First supplemental package in the go-agents ecosystem
- **Purpose**: Extends go-agents primitive interface library with orchestration capabilities

### Focus Areas

This package addresses capabilities intentionally outside the scope of the go-agents primitive library:

- **Multi-Hub Coordination**: Agent coordination across multiple hubs with hierarchical organization
- **State Management**: LangGraph-inspired state graph execution with transitions, predicates, and checkpointing
- **Messaging Primitives**: Structured inter-agent communication with channel-based delivery
- **Workflow Patterns**: Sequential chains, parallel execution, conditional routing, stateful workflows
- **Observability Infrastructure**: Execution trace capture, decision logging, confidence scoring, performance metrics
- **Agent Role Abstractions**: Orchestrator, processor, and actor patterns

### Research Foundation

Preliminary research for Go-native agent orchestration was conducted in **github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-research**, which contains:
- Initial hub architecture implementation
- Multi-hub coordination experiments
- Agent registration and messaging patterns
- Go concurrency exploration for agent workflows

The hub code from this research repository should be ported and refined as the foundation for go-agents-orchestration.

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation (Implementation)

**Planning Complete**: All planning objectives have been achieved. Package architecture is defined, core interfaces designed, and comprehensive documentation created.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Go module initialized (`github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-orchestration`)
- ✅ go-agents@v0.1.0 dependency validated and integrated
- ✅ config package created with go-agents integration
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, design-decisions)
- ✅ Detailed implementation guide (`_context/phase-1-hub-messaging.md`)

**Phase 1 Objectives**:
1. Implement `messaging/` package (message structures and builders)
2. Implement `hub/` package (agent coordination and routing)
3. Create comprehensive tests (80%+ coverage)
4. Validate multi-hub coordination patterns
5. Create integration examples with go-agents

**Package Structure** (confirmed):
- `messaging/` - Message primitives (Level 1)
- `hub/` - Agent coordination (Level 2)
- `config/` - Configuration structures with go-agents integration

**Future Phases**: State management (Phase 2), workflow patterns (Phase 3), observability (Phase 4).

### Template for Future Supplemental Packages

As the first supplemental package, go-agents-orchestration serves as a template for future packages in the ecosystem. It will:
- Validate go-agents public API through real-world usage
- Establish patterns for supplemental package development
- Provide feedback to go-agents for API improvements
- Follow pre-release versioning (v0.x.x) during validation period
- Graduate to v1.0.0 after validation

## Directory Conventions

**Hidden Directories (`.` prefix)**: Any directory prefixed with `.` (e.g., `.admin`) is hidden from you and you should not access or modify the documents unless explicitly directed to.

**Context Directories (`_` prefix)**: Any directory prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_context`) is available for you to reference and represents contextually important artifacts for this project.

## Documentation Standards

### Core Project Documents

**ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical specifications of current implementations, interface definitions, design patterns, and system architecture. Focus on concrete implementation details and current state.

**PROJECT.md**: Project roadmap, scope definition, design philosophy, development phases, and success criteria. Defines what the package provides, what it doesn't provide, and planned development approach.

**README.md**: User-facing documentation for installation, usage examples, configuration, and getting started information.

### Context Documents (`_context/`)

Context documents fall into two categories:

**Implementation Guides**: Active development documentation for features currently being implemented
- Format: `_context/[feature-name].md`
- Structure: Problem context, architecture approach, then comprehensive step-by-step code modifications based on current codebase
- Implementation Strategy: Structure implementation in phases separating architectural preparation from feature development:
  - **Preparation Phase**: Refactor existing code structure and interfaces without changing functionality
  - **Feature Phase**: Add new capabilities on the prepared foundation
  - This prevents mixing layout changes with feature additions, reducing complexity and debugging difficulty
- Focus: Concrete implementation steps, file-by-file changes, code examples for actual modifications needed
- Conclusion: Future extensibility examples separate from core implementation steps

**Development Summaries**: Historical documentation capturing completed development efforts
- Format: `_context/.archive/[NN]-[completed-effort].md` where `NN` is the next numerical sequence.
- Structure: Starting point, implementation decisions, final architecture state, current blockers
- Purpose: Comprehensive, objective, factual summary of what was implemented, decisions made, and remaining challenges
- Tone: Professional, clear, factual without conjecture or enthusiasm

### Documentation Tone and Style

All documentation should be written in a clear, objective, and factual manner with professional tone. Focus on concrete implementation details and actual outcomes rather than speculative content or unfounded claims.

## Planning Phase Guidance

### Planning Objectives

The planning phase should achieve the following objectives from `_context/orchestration-initialization.md`:

1. **Review Research Repository**: Analyze the hub implementation and patterns from go-agents-research
2. **Define Package Architecture**: Establish clear boundaries between hub, messaging, state, patterns, and observability packages
3. **Design Core Interfaces**: Define the primary types and interfaces for each package
4. **Establish Integration Patterns**: Determine how orchestration primitives integrate with go-agents agents
5. **Plan Development Phases**: Break down implementation into manageable phases
6. **Document Design Decisions**: Capture architectural choices and rationale

### Planning Deliverables

During the planning phase, create the following documents:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical specifications, interface definitions, design patterns, package boundaries
2. **PROJECT.md**: Project scope, development roadmap, design philosophy, validation criteria
3. **README.md**: Package overview, installation instructions, quick start examples
4. **_context/design-decisions.md**: Detailed design decisions, architectural trade-offs, and rationale

### Architectural Questions

The planning phase should explore and answer these key architectural questions:

1. **State Management**: Are Go channels + contexts sufficient, or do we need more sophisticated state machines?
2. **Hub Scalability**: Can the hub pattern support recursive composition (hubs containing orchestrator agents managing sub-hubs)?
3. **Observability Overhead**: How much observability can we add without impacting production performance?
4. **Go Concurrency Patterns**: What unique state management patterns emerge from Go's concurrency model that aren't possible in Python?
5. **API Design**: How should the orchestration primitives integrate with go-agents? What interfaces make sense?
6. **Hub as Primary Primitive**: Should hub be the primary coordination primitive, or should we have higher-level orchestration abstractions?
7. **Agent Registration**: How should agents be registered with hubs? Direct registration vs. configuration-driven?
8. **State Graphs and Hub Messaging**: What is the relationship between state graphs and hub messaging?
9. **Workflow Pattern Separation**: Should workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, etc.) be separate from state management?
10. **Observability Coupling**: How should observability be captured without tight coupling to workflow execution?
11. **Error Propagation**: How should errors propagate through multi-agent workflows?
12. **Lifecycle Hooks**: What lifecycle hooks are needed for workflow initialization and cleanup?

### Research Repository Integration

When reviewing the go-agents-research repository:

- Analyze the hub architecture implementation for strengths and limitations
- Identify patterns that worked well in experiments
- Document patterns that need refinement
- Consider how research code should be ported vs. redesigned
- Evaluate which concepts should be promoted to production-grade abstractions

### Design Decision Documentation

Document design decisions in `_context/design-decisions.md` with:

- **Context**: What problem or question prompted this decision?
- **Options Considered**: What alternatives were evaluated?
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why?
- **Rationale**: Technical reasoning behind the choice
- **Trade-offs**: What was gained and what was sacrificed?
- **Consequences**: How does this decision impact the architecture?
- **Validation**: How will we know if this decision was correct?

## Code Design Principles

The following principles from go-agents should guide implementation when the planning phase transitions to development. These are provided as guidance for future implementation, not as requirements for the planning phase.

### From go-agents Design Principles

Apply these principles from the parent library:

1. **Minimal Abstractions**: Provide only essential primitives for agent coordination
2. **Format Extensibility**: Enable new patterns without modifying core code
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Compose workflows through declarative configuration where appropriate
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's type system for compile-time safety
5. **Go-Native Patterns**: Embrace Go concurrency idioms rather than porting Python patterns

### Encapsulation and Data Access
**Principle**: Always provide methods for accessing meaningful values from complex nested structures. Do not expose or require direct field access to inner state.

**Rationale**: Direct field access to nested structures (`obj.Field1.Field2.Field3`) creates brittle code that breaks when internal structures change, violates encapsulation, and makes the code harder to maintain and understand.

**Implementation**:
- Provide getter methods that encapsulate the logic for extracting meaningful data
- Hide complex nested field access behind simple, semantic method calls
- Make the interface intention-revealing rather than implementation-revealing

**Example**: Instead of `chunk.Choices[0].Delta.Content`, provide `chunk.ExtractContent()` that handles the nested access, bounds checking, and returns a clean result.

### Layered Code Organization
**Principle**: Structure code within files in dependency order - define foundational types before the types that depend on them.

**Rationale**: When higher-level types depend on lower-level types, defining dependencies first eliminates forward reference issues, reduces compiler errors during development, and creates more readable code that flows naturally from foundation to implementation.

**Implementation**:
- Define data structures before the methods that use them
- Define interfaces before the concrete types that implement them
- Define request/response types before the client methods that return them
- Order allows verification that concrete types properly implement interfaces before attempting to use them

**Example**: In capability implementations, define request structs before the `CreateRequest()` method that returns them, enabling immediate verification that the struct correctly implements the required interface.

### Configuration and Validation Separation
**Principle**: Configuration packages should handle structure, defaults, and serialization only. Validation of configuration contents is the responsibility of the consuming package.

**Rationale**: Separating configuration loading from validation prevents the configuration package from needing to know about domain-specific types and rules. This maintains clean package boundaries and prevents circular dependencies.

**Implementation**:
- Configuration packages provide: structure definitions, default values, merge logic, file loading/saving
- Configuration packages do NOT: validate domain-specific values, import domain packages, enforce business rules
- Consuming packages validate configuration at point of use with their domain knowledge
- Validation errors should be clear about which package/component rejected the configuration

### Package Organization Depth
**Principle**: Avoid package subdirectories deeper than a single level. Deep nesting often indicates over-engineered abstractions or unclear responsibility boundaries.

**Rationale**: When package structures become deeply nested (e.g., `pkg/models/formats/capabilities/types/`), it typically signals architectural issues: the abstractions aren't quite right, import paths become unwieldy, package boundaries blur, and circular dependencies become more likely.

**Implementation**:
- Keep package subdirectories to a maximum of one level deep
- If you find yourself creating deeply nested packages, step back and reconsider the architectural design
- Focus on clear responsibility boundaries rather than hierarchical organization
- Prefer flat, well-named packages over deep taxonomies

### Configuration Lifecycle and Scope
**Principle**: Configuration should only exist to initialize the structures they are associated with. They should not persist beyond the point of initialization.

**Rationale**: Allowing configuration infrastructure to persist too deeply into package layers prevents the package structure from having any meaning and creates tight coupling between configuration and runtime behavior. Configuration should be transformed into domain objects at system boundaries.

**Implementation**:
- Use configuration only during initialization/construction phases
- Transform configuration into domain-specific structures immediately after loading
- Do not pass configuration objects through multiple layers
- Domain objects should not hold references to their originating configuration
- Runtime behavior should depend on initialized state, not configuration values

### Interface-Based Layer Interconnection
**Principle**: Layers should be interconnected through interfaces, not concrete types.

**Rationale**: Interface-based connections between layers provide loose coupling, enable testing through mocks, allow multiple implementations, and create clear contracts between system components. This makes the system more maintainable and extensible.

**Implementation**:
- Define interfaces at package boundaries for all inter-layer communication
- Higher layers depend on interfaces defined by lower layers
- Concrete implementations should be created at the edges of the system
- Use dependency injection to provide implementations to higher layers
- Avoid direct instantiation of concrete types from other packages

### Package Dependency Hierarchy
**Principle**: Maintain a clear package dependency hierarchy with unidirectional dependencies flowing from high-level to low-level packages.

**Rationale**: A well-defined dependency hierarchy prevents circular dependencies, makes the architecture easier to understand, and ensures that changes to high-level packages don't affect low-level ones.

**Implementation**:
- Lower layers must not import higher layers
- Shared types should be defined in the lowest layer that needs them
- Use interfaces to invert dependencies when needed

**Note**: The specific package hierarchy for go-agents-orchestration will be established during the planning phase. The projected structure in `_context/orchestration-initialization.md` (hub/, messaging/, state/, patterns/, observability/) is tentative.

### Implementation Guide Refactoring Order
**Principle**: When creating implementation guides for refactoring, always structure changes to proceed from lowest-level packages to highest-level packages following the dependency hierarchy.

**Rationale**: Refactoring in bottom-up order ensures that when updating a package, all its dependencies have already been updated to their new interfaces. This prevents temporary broken states where higher-level code tries to use outdated lower-level interfaces.

**Implementation**:
- Start refactoring with the lowest-level packages that have no dependencies on other packages being changed
- Progress upward through the dependency hierarchy
- Each step should result in a compilable state
- Higher-level packages should only be refactored after all their dependencies are complete

### Parameter Encapsulation
**Principle**: If more than two parameters are needed for a function or method, encapsulate the parameters into a structure.

**Rationale**: Functions with many parameters become difficult to read, maintain, and extend. Parameter structures provide named fields that make function calls self-documenting, enable optional parameters through zero values, and allow for easy extension without breaking existing calls.

**Implementation**:
- Define request structures for functions requiring more than two parameters
- Use meaningful struct names that describe the operation or context
- Group related parameters logically within the structure
- Consider future extensibility when designing parameter structures

**Example**: Instead of `Execute(ctx, capability, input, timeout, retries)`, use `Execute(request ExecuteRequest)` where `ExecuteRequest` contains all parameters with clear field names.

### Package Subdirectory Prohibition
**Principle**: Avoid package subdirectories in Go projects. Use flat package organization or separate packages with different names.

**Rationale**: Package subdirectories create compilation complexity, unclear boundaries, and often indicate architectural problems that should be resolved through proper package separation. When you find yourself wanting subdirectories, it usually means the concerns should be split into separate packages.

**Implementation**:
- Keep related files in the same directory when they need to share types directly
- Use separate packages with different names for truly different concerns
- If a package directory becomes too large, consider splitting responsibilities rather than adding subdirectories
- Clear file naming can provide organization within a single package directory

### Contract Interface Pattern
**Principle**: Lower-level packages define minimal interfaces (contracts) that higher-level packages must implement to use their functionality.

**Rationale**: This pattern enables dependency inversion, creates clean boundaries, prevents circular dependencies, and allows lower-level packages to specify exactly what they need without coupling to higher-level implementations. It provides a powerful mechanism for inter-package communication.

**Implementation**:
- Lower-level packages define interface contracts for what they need from callers
- Higher-level packages implement these contracts explicitly (avoid embedding)
- Keep contract interfaces minimal - only include essential methods
- Use descriptive names that indicate the contract purpose
- Document the contract interface clearly to guide implementers

## Testing Strategy and Conventions

The following testing strategy from go-agents should be applied when implementation begins. These conventions are provided as a framework for future development, not as requirements for the planning phase.

### Test Organization Structure
**Principle**: Tests are organized in a separate `tests/` directory that mirrors the package structure, keeping production code clean and focused.

**Rationale**: Separating tests from implementation prevents package directories from being cluttered with test files. This separation makes the codebase easier to navigate and ensures the package structure reflects production architecture rather than test organization.

**Implementation**:
- Create `tests/<package>/` directories corresponding to each package
- Test files follow Go naming convention: `<file>_test.go`
- Test directory structure mirrors package structure exactly

**Note**: The specific package structure will be established during planning. Test organization will follow whatever package structure is designed.

### Black-Box Testing Approach
**Principle**: All tests use black-box testing with `package <name>_test`, testing only the public API.

**Rationale**: Black-box tests validate the library from a consumer perspective, ensuring the public API behaves correctly. This approach prevents tests from depending on internal implementation details, makes refactoring safer, and reduces test volume by focusing only on exported functionality.

**Implementation**:
- Use `package <name>_test` in all test files
- Import the package being tested
- Test only exported types, functions, and methods
- Cannot access unexported members (compile error if attempted)
- If testing unexported functionality seems necessary, the functionality should probably be exported

### Table-Driven Test Pattern
**Principle**: Use table-driven tests for testing multiple scenarios with different inputs.

**Rationale**: Table-driven tests reduce code duplication, make test cases easy to add or modify, and provide clear documentation of expected behavior across different inputs. They're the idiomatic Go testing pattern for parameterized tests.

**Implementation**:
- Define test cases as a slice of structs with `name`, input fields, and `expected` output
- Iterate over test cases using `t.Run(tt.name, ...)` for isolated subtests
- Each subtest runs independently with clear failure reporting

### HTTP Mocking for Provider Tests
**Principle**: Use `httptest.Server` to mock HTTP responses when testing integrations with go-agents or external services.

**Rationale**: HTTP mocking allows testing logic without live services or credentials. It provides deterministic, fast, isolated tests that verify HTTP request/response handling without external dependencies.

**Implementation**:
- Create `httptest.NewServer` with handler function that returns mock responses
- Pass `server.URL` to configuration
- Verify request formatting and response parsing
- Use `defer server.Close()` to clean up

### Coverage Requirements
**Principle**: Maintain 80% minimum test coverage across all packages, with 100% coverage for critical paths.

**Rationale**: High coverage ensures reliability, catches regressions, and validates edge cases. Critical paths (parsing, validation, routing, state transitions) require complete coverage as failures in these areas have cascading effects.

**Implementation**:
- Run coverage analysis: `go test ./tests/<package>/... -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./<package>/...`
- Review coverage: `go tool cover -func=coverage.out`
- Generate HTML report: `go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html`
- Critical paths require 100% coverage

**Note**: Coverage requirements apply when implementation exists. During planning, focus on designing testable interfaces and anticipating test scenarios.

### Test Naming Conventions
**Principle**: Test function names clearly describe what is being tested and the scenario.

**Rationale**: Clear test names serve as documentation and make failures immediately understandable without reading test code.

**Implementation**:
- Format: `Test<Type>_<Method>_<Scenario>`
- Use descriptive scenario names in table-driven tests
- Avoid abbreviations in test names
