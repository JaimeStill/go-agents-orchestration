# go-agents-orchestration - Project Roadmap

## Project Scope

### Core Mission

Provide Go-native agent coordination primitives that extend [go-agents](https://github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents) with multi-agent orchestration, LangGraph-inspired state management, and composable workflow patterns.

### What This Package Provides

**Hub Coordination:**
- Multi-hub agent networking with hierarchical organization
- Agent registration with message handlers
- Cross-hub message routing and communication
- Hub lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown, cleanup)
- Fractal growth through shared agents across hubs

**Messaging Primitives:**
- Structured message types for inter-agent communication
- Message builders for fluent message construction
- Message routing and filtering logic
- Channel-based message delivery using Go concurrency

**State Management:**
- State graph execution with nodes, edges, and transitions
- State structure definitions and mutation patterns
- Transition predicates for conditional routing
- Checkpointing for recovery and rollback
- Cycle detection and loop handling

**Workflow Patterns:**
- Sequential chains with state accumulation
- Parallel execution (fan-out/fan-in) with result aggregation
- Conditional routing with dynamic handler selection
- Stateful workflows with cycles and retries

**Observability Infrastructure:**
- Execution trace capture across workflow steps
- Decision point logging with reasoning
- Performance metrics (token usage, timing, retries)
- Production debugging and optimization support

### What This Package Does NOT Provide

Capabilities intentionally left to the go-agents library:

- **LLM Protocol Execution**: Chat, Vision, Tools, Embeddings
- **Provider Integration**: OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, etc.
- **HTTP Transport**: Connection pooling, retries, streaming
- **Capability Format System**: Provider-specific API structures
- **Configuration Management**: Provider and model configuration

## Development Approach

### Bottom-Up Construction

Build from lowest-level primitives to highest-level features:

```
Level 1: messaging/     → Message primitives (no dependencies)
Level 2: hub/          → Agent coordination (depends on messaging)
Level 3: state/        → State graph execution (depends on messaging)
Level 4: patterns/     → Workflow patterns (depends on hub + state)
Level 5: observability/ → Cross-cutting metrics (depends on all)
```

**Rationale**: Each layer validates before adding the next. Prevents temporary broken states during development.

### Configuration-Driven Initialization

Following go-agents patterns:

- Core structures initialized through configuration
- Configuration transforms to domain objects at boundaries
- Runtime behavior depends on initialized state, not config values
- Configuration does not persist beyond initialization

### Testing Strategy

- **Black-box testing**: `package_test` suffix, public API only
- **Table-driven tests**: Multiple scenarios with clear documentation
- **Coverage requirements**: 80% minimum, 100% for critical paths
- **HTTP mocking**: Test integrations without live services

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

**Goal**: Establish messaging and hub coordination primitives.

**Packages:**
- `messaging/`: Message structures, builders, types ✅
- `hub/`: Hub interface, agent registration, message routing ✅
- `config/`: Hub configuration structures ✅

**Communication Patterns:**
- Send (fire-and-forget) ✅
- Request/Response (with correlation) ✅
- Broadcast (all agents except sender) ✅
- Pub/Sub (topic-based messaging) ✅

**Deliverables:**
- Working hub implementation ported from research ✅
- Multi-hub coordination support ✅
- Integration examples with go-agents ✅
- Comprehensive test coverage (86%) ✅
- Documentation (README, PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE) ✅

**Success Criteria:**
- Agents can register with hubs via message handlers ✅
- All communication patterns work correctly ✅
- Multi-hub coordination validated ✅
- Tests achieve 80%+ coverage ✅ (86% achieved)

**Example:**
- `examples/phase-01-hubs`: ISS Maintenance EVA scenario demonstrating all communication patterns with 4 agents across 2 hubs

### Phase 2: State Management

**Goal**: LangGraph-inspired state graph execution engine.

**Packages:**
- `state/`: StateGraph, StateNode, Edge, Executor, Checkpoint

**Features:**
- State graph definitions (nodes, edges, transitions)
- Transition predicates for conditional routing
- State execution engine
- Checkpointing for recovery
- Cycle detection and handling

**Integration:**
- State graph nodes CAN use hub for coordination
- State graphs execute independently of hubs
- Nodes can be LLM agents, hub agents, or pure functions

**Success Criteria:**
- State graphs execute with correct state transitions
- Checkpointing enables recovery from failures
- Integration with hub messaging works
- Graph execution is type-safe and testable

### Phase 3: Workflow Patterns

**Goal**: High-level workflow compositions built on state graphs.

**Packages:**
- `patterns/`: Chain, Parallel, Conditional, Stateful

**Patterns:**
- **Sequential chains**: Linear workflows with state accumulation
- **Parallel execution**: Fan-out/fan-in with state merge
- **Conditional routing**: State-based routing decisions
- **Stateful workflows**: Complex state machines with cycles

**Integration:**
- Patterns use state graphs + hub messaging
- Composable pattern building blocks
- Declarative workflow construction

**Success Criteria:**
- All workflow patterns implemented and tested
- Patterns compose correctly
- Examples demonstrate real-world usage
- Documentation covers common patterns

### Phase 4: Observability

**Goal**: Production-grade observability without performance degradation.

**Packages:**
- `observability/`: Trace, Metrics, Decision logging

**Features:**
- Execution trace capture across workflows
- Decision point logging with reasoning
- Confidence scoring utilities
- Performance metrics (latency, token usage, retries)

**Integration:**
- Cross-cutting hooks in hub, state, patterns
- Minimal performance overhead
- Optional (can be disabled)

**Success Criteria:**
- Comprehensive tracing without degrading performance
- Metrics provide production debugging insights
- Decision logging captures reasoning
- Observability can be toggled on/off

## Success Criteria

The go-agents-orchestration package is successful when:

1. **API Validation**: Successfully exercises go-agents public API, identifying friction points or missing capabilities
2. **Pattern Completeness**: Implements sequential, parallel, conditional, and stateful workflow patterns
3. **Hub Coordination**: Demonstrates multi-hub coordination with cross-hub messaging
4. **State Execution**: Provides LangGraph-style state graph execution with Go-native patterns
5. **Observability**: Production-grade observability without performance degradation
6. **Go-Native Design**: Leverages Go concurrency primitives naturally
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples for all patterns
8. **Test Coverage**: Achieves 80%+ test coverage with black-box testing

## Package Lifecycle

### Pre-Release Phase (v0.x.x)

- Breaking changes allowed during validation
- Validate go-agents integration patterns
- Gather feedback on API design
- Iterate on core abstractions

### Release Candidate (v1.0.0-rc.x)

- API stabilized
- All four phases complete
- Documentation complete
- Test coverage meets requirements

### Stable Release (v1.0.0+)

- API stability guarantees
- Production-ready
- Semantic versioning followed
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Design Philosophy

### From go-agents

1. **Minimal Abstractions**: Provide only essential primitives for agent coordination
2. **Format Extensibility**: Enable new patterns without modifying core code
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Compose workflows through declarative configuration where appropriate
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's type system for compile-time safety
5. **Go-Native Patterns**: Embrace Go concurrency idioms rather than porting Python patterns

### Orchestration-Specific

1. **Hub as Networking Fabric**: Persistent coordination primitive for agent networking
2. **State Graphs as Workflows**: Transient execution contexts for stateful workflows
3. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex behaviors through composition
4. **Bottom-Up Development**: Validate each layer before adding the next
5. **Configuration Lifecycle**: Config exists only during initialization

## Template for Future Packages

As the first supplemental package in the go-agents ecosystem, go-agents-orchestration serves as a template:

- Validates go-agents public API through real-world usage
- Establishes patterns for supplemental package development
- Provides feedback to go-agents for API improvements
- Demonstrates integration patterns for future packages
- Documents development approach and testing strategy
