# Design Decisions

This document captures key architectural decisions made during the planning and development of go-agents-orchestration, including context, alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences.

## Decision 1: Hub as Primary Coordination Primitive

**Context**: Need a coordination mechanism for multi-agent systems.

**Options Considered**:
1. Direct agent-to-agent communication (no coordination primitive)
2. Hub/broker pattern for message routing
3. Event bus pattern
4. Actor model framework

**Decision**: Hub pattern as persistent networking fabric.

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear coordination boundary (agents within a hub)
- Enables multi-hub networking through shared agents (fractal growth)
- Simplifies message routing and delivery
- Proven pattern from research prototype
- Natural fit for Go concurrency model (channels + goroutines)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Clear coordination boundary, message routing, multi-hub support
- **Sacrificed**: Direct agent-to-agent communication (must go through hub)

**Consequences**:
- Hub becomes central to orchestration architecture
- Multi-hub coordination enables complex agent networks
- Agents can participate in multiple hubs simultaneously

**Validation**: Research prototype demonstrated hub pattern works well for Go-based multi-agent coordination.

## Decision 2: Minimal Agent Interface

**Context**: Hub needs to register and coordinate agents, but agents come from go-agents library.

**Options Considered**:
1. Hub-specific agent implementation (extend go-agents Agent)
2. Minimal interface contract (`ID()` only)
3. Rich interface with lifecycle methods

**Decision**: Minimal interface with single `ID()` method.

**Rationale**:
- Loose coupling between hub and agent implementations
- Users can wrap go-agents Agent however they want
- Follows contract interface pattern from go-agents design principles
- Enables composition over inheritance
- Testability (easy to create mock agents)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Flexibility, loose coupling, easy testing
- **Sacrificed**: Hub cannot directly invoke agent methods

**Consequences**:
- Users compose agents with hub participation through wrapper pattern
- Hub remains agnostic to what agents actually do
- MessageHandler provides extension point for agent behavior

**Validation**: Research prototype used this pattern successfully.

## Decision 3: Message Structure Design

**Context**: Need structured messages for inter-agent communication.

**Options Considered**:
1. Port full research message structure (20+ fields)
2. Minimal core (ID, From, To, Data only)
3. Minimal core + optional metadata fields

**Decision**: Minimal core with optional metadata (Option 3).

**Rationale**:
- Start simple, add fields as patterns emerge
- Avoid over-engineering for unproven use cases
- Essential fields: ID, From, To, Type, Data, Timestamp
- Optional fields: ReplyTo (correlation), Topic (pub/sub), Priority, Headers
- Dropped complex fields for MVP: TTL, DeliveryMode, Ack, Retry, Sequence

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Simplicity, clear essential fields
- **Sacrificed**: Advanced features (will add if needed)

**Consequences**:
- Clean, understandable message structure
- Room to grow without breaking changes
- Focus on core communication patterns first

**Validation**: MVP will reveal if additional fields are needed.

## Decision 4: State Management Deferred to Phase 2

**Context**: LangGraph-style state graphs are a key feature but add complexity.

**Options Considered**:
1. Implement state graphs in Phase 1 (all at once)
2. Build hub first, add state graphs later (bottom-up)
3. Build state graphs first, add hub later (top-down)

**Decision**: Bottom-up approach - hub foundation first (Phase 1), state graphs later (Phase 2).

**Rationale**:
- Validate hub pattern before adding state complexity
- State graphs depend on messaging infrastructure
- Bottom-up development reduces risk
- Each layer can be tested independently
- Hub + messaging provides immediate value

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Solid foundation, reduced risk, incremental validation
- **Sacrificed**: Delayed state graph features

**Consequences**:
- Phase 1 delivers working hub coordination
- Phase 2 adds state graphs on validated foundation
- Clear separation between persistent coordination (hub) and transient workflows (state graphs)

**Validation**: go-agents used similar phased approach successfully.

---

## Decision 5: Hub and State Graph Relationship

**Context**: Need to clarify relationship between hub (coordination) and state graph (workflow).

**Options Considered**:
1. State graphs use hub internally for all node communication
2. State graphs are completely independent of hub
3. State graphs CAN use hub but don't have to (dual purpose)

**Decision**: Dual purpose (Option 3) - state graphs are independent but can leverage hub.

**Rationale**:
- Hub: Persistent networking fabric for agent coordination
- State Graph: Transient workflow execution with stateful transitions
- These are complementary, not mutually exclusive
- State graph nodes CAN be hub agents when needed
- State graphs CAN execute without hub (pure computation nodes)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Flexibility, clear separation of concerns
- **Sacrificed**: Simpler "one way to do it" model

**Consequences**:
- Hub and state/ packages are independently useful
- Users can choose: hub-only, state-only, or both
- Integration patterns emerge organically

**Validation**: Will be validated during Phase 2 implementation.

## Decision 6: Configuration Strategy

**Context**: Need configuration structures for hub initialization.

**Options Considered**:
1. Code-first only (no config files)
2. Declarative config files (YAML/JSON)
3. Code-first with config structures (go-agents pattern)

**Decision**: Code-first with config structures (Option 3).

**Rationale**:
- Follows go-agents conventions
- Configuration transforms to domain objects at boundaries
- No persistence beyond initialization
- Flexibility to load from code, files, environment, etc.
- Type-safe configuration with validation

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Type safety, flexibility, alignment with go-agents
- **Sacrificed**: Declarative workflow definitions (can add later)

**Consequences**:
- HubConfig references go-agents AgentConfig
- Configuration exists only during initialization
- Users can build config loaders as needed

**Validation**: go-agents pattern proven effective.

## Decision 7: Package Dependency Hierarchy

**Context**: Need clear package organization to prevent circular dependencies.

**Options Considered**:
1. Flat structure (all packages at same level)
2. Hierarchical with strict dependency rules
3. Nested packages (subdirectories)

**Decision**: Hierarchical with strict bottom-up dependencies (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Clear dependency flow: messaging → hub → state → patterns → observability
- Each layer can be validated independently
- Follows layered code organization principle
- Avoid deep nesting (package subdirectory prohibition principle)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Clean dependencies, no circular imports, independent validation
- **Sacrificed**: Cannot have bidirectional dependencies

**Consequences**:
- Implementation order enforced by dependencies
- Lower layers cannot import higher layers
- Testing can validate each layer independently

**Validation**: Structure mirrors go-agents successful package organization.

## Decision 8: MessageHandler Callback Pattern

**Context**: How should agents process incoming messages?

**Options Considered**:
1. Interface with Process() method
2. Callback function (MessageHandler)
3. Channel-based message delivery (agents pull)

**Decision**: Callback function pattern (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Simple, flexible, proven in research
- No interface implementation required
- Easy to create inline handlers
- Supports request/response correlation
- Aligns with Go functional patterns

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Simplicity, flexibility
- **Sacrificed**: Type safety of interface methods

**Consequences**:
- Handlers are first-class functions
- Easy to compose handlers
- Clear extension point for agent behavior

**Validation**: Research prototype validated this pattern.

---

## Decision 9: Multi-Hub Coordination Strategy

**Context**: How should hubs interact with each other?

**Options Considered**:
1. Hub-to-hub direct communication protocol
2. Shared agents across hubs (fractal growth)
3. Central hub registry/coordinator

**Decision**: Shared agents across hubs (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Agents can register with multiple hubs
- Agents act as bridges between hubs
- Fractal growth pattern emerges naturally
- No central coordinator needed
- Proven in research prototype

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Decentralized coordination, scalability, simplicity
- **Sacrificed**: Direct hub-to-hub messaging

**Consequences**:
- Complex agent networks possible through hub composition
- No hub hierarchy or central coordination needed
- Agents manage cross-hub message routing

**Validation**: Research multi-hub example demonstrated this pattern.

---

## Decision 10: Testing Strategy

**Context**: How should the package be tested?

**Options Considered**:
1. White-box testing (package name, access internals)
2. Black-box testing (package_test, public API only)
3. Mixed approach

**Decision**: Black-box testing with `package_test` suffix (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Follows go-agents testing approach
- Validates public API from consumer perspective
- Prevents testing implementation details
- Makes refactoring safer
- Reduces test maintenance

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: API-focused tests, refactoring safety
- **Sacrificed**: Cannot test unexported functions directly

**Consequences**:
- All tests in tests/ directory
- Tests import packages they test
- 80% coverage requirement for public API
- If unexported functionality needs testing, consider exporting it

**Validation**: go-agents successfully uses this approach.

## Decision 11: Observability in Phase 4

**Context**: When should comprehensive observability be added?

**Options Considered**:
1. Build observability from the start (all phases)
2. Add basic logging, defer metrics to Phase 4
3. No observability until needed

**Decision**: Basic logging now, comprehensive observability in Phase 4 (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Focus on correctness first
- Avoid premature optimization
- Basic logging sufficient for development
- Comprehensive metrics need all layers implemented
- Cross-cutting concern best added last

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Focus on core functionality, simpler early phases
- **Sacrificed**: Delayed production-grade metrics

**Consequences**:
- Minimal metrics in Phase 1 (agent count, message count)
- slog for structured logging
- Phase 4 adds execution tracing, decision logging, performance metrics

**Validation**: Will know what metrics are needed after implementing patterns.

---

## Decision 12: Avoid Premature Abstraction

**Context**: During planning, considered biological metaphors (Cell, Organelle) and role abstractions (Orchestrator, Processor, Actor).

**Options Considered**:
1. Define all role abstractions upfront
2. Build foundation first, let abstractions emerge organically
3. Skip abstractions entirely

**Decision**: Build foundation first, let abstractions emerge (Option 2).

**Rationale**:
- Research prototype showed simple hub + MessageHandler works
- Role patterns can emerge from usage
- Avoid over-engineering for unproven use cases
- Keep vocabulary technical, not metaphorical
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle

**Trade-offs**:
- **Gained**: Simplicity, focus on working code
- **Sacrificed**: Upfront abstractions (can add later if needed)

**Consequences**:
- Phase 1 delivers minimal, working foundation
- Role patterns emerge from real usage
- Abstractions added when patterns are clear

**Validation**: Collaboration with user prevented over-architecting.

2. **Minimal Abstractions**: Essential primitives only
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Initialize through configuration
4. **Go-Native Patterns**: Embrace Go idioms
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear package boundaries
6. **Validation Before Extension**: Test each layer independently
