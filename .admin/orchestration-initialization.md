# go-agents-orchestration - Project Initialization

## Context

**go-agents** (`github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents@v0.1.0`) is a primitive agent interface library for Go that provides foundational abstractions for building LLM-powered applications. The library was published as a pre-release on 2025-10-09 and is now ready to be extended through supplemental packages.

### What go-agents Provides

- **Protocol Abstractions**: Standardized interfaces for core LLM interactions (Chat, Vision, Tools, Embeddings)
- **Capability Format System**: Extensible format registration supporting provider-specific API structures
- **Provider Integration**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, etc.)
- **Transport Layer**: HTTP client orchestration with connection pooling, retries, and streaming support
- **Configuration Management**: Type-safe configuration with human-readable durations and validation

### What go-agents Does NOT Provide

The following capabilities are intentionally outside the scope of the primitive interface library and should be implemented as supplemental packages:

- **Tool Execution**: Runtime execution of tool functions, security policies, and result handling
- **Context Management**: Token counting, context window optimization, and conversation memory
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Agent coordination, workflow graphs, and state machines ← **THIS IS THE FOCUS**
- **Retrieval Systems**: Vector stores, RAG implementations, and document processing pipelines
- **Fine-Tuning Infrastructure**: Model training, evaluation, and deployment tooling

## Project Overview

**go-agents-orchestration** is the first supplemental package in the go-agents ecosystem, focusing on Go-native agent coordination primitives with LangGraph-inspired state management, multi-hub messaging architecture, and composable workflow patterns.

### Repository Details

- **Repository**: `github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-orchestration`
- **Dependency**: `github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents@v0.1.0`
- **Development Priority**: First (enables agent coordination patterns for subsequent packages)

### Research Foundation

Preliminary research for Go-native agent orchestration was conducted in:

**Repository**: `github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-research`

This repository contains:
- Initial hub architecture implementation
- Multi-hub coordination experiments
- Agent registration and messaging patterns
- Go concurrency exploration for agent workflows

The hub code from this research repository should be ported and refined as the foundation for go-agents-orchestration.

## Project Scope

### Core Capabilities

**Hub Architecture**:
- Multi-hub coordination with hierarchical organization
- Agent registration across multiple hubs with context-aware handlers
- Cross-hub message routing and pub/sub patterns
- Hub lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown, cleanup)
- Foundation for recursive composition (hubs containing orchestrator agents managing sub-hubs)

**Messaging Primitives**:
- Structured message types for inter-agent communication
- Message builders for constructing complex communications
- Message filtering and routing logic
- Channel-based message delivery using Go concurrency

**State Management**:
- State graph execution with transitions and predicates
- State structure definitions and mutation patterns
- Checkpointing for recovery and rollback
- Cycle detection and loop handling
- Leverage Go concurrency primitives (channels, goroutines, contexts)
- Explore Go-native patterns rather than directly porting Python approaches

**Workflow Patterns**:
- **Sequential chains**: Linear workflows with state accumulation
- **Parallel execution**: Fan-out/fan-in with state merge and result aggregation
- **Conditional routing**: State-based routing decisions with dynamic handler selection
- **Stateful workflows**: Complex state machines with cycles, retries, and checkpoints

**Observability Infrastructure**:
- Execution trace capture across workflow steps
- Decision point logging with reasoning
- Confidence scoring utilities for agent outputs
- Performance metrics (token usage, timing, retries)
- Designed for production debugging and optimization

**Agent Role Abstractions**:
- **Orchestrator**: Supervisory agents driving workflows, registered in multiple hubs
- **Processor**: Functional agents with clear input→output contracts
- **Actor**: Profile-based agents with perspectives (foundation for future expansion)

## Key Architectural Questions

The planning and development phases should explore and answer:

1. **State Management**: Are Go channels + contexts sufficient, or do we need more sophisticated state machines?
2. **Hub Scalability**: Can the hub pattern support recursive composition (hubs containing orchestrator agents managing sub-hubs)?
3. **Observability Overhead**: How much observability can we add without impacting production performance?
4. **Go Concurrency Patterns**: What unique state management patterns emerge from Go's concurrency model that aren't possible in Python?
5. **API Design**: How should the orchestration primitives integrate with go-agents? What interfaces make sense?

## Planning Phase Objectives

The initial planning phase should:

1. **Review Research Repository**: Analyze the hub implementation and patterns from go-agents-research
2. **Define Package Architecture**: Establish clear boundaries between hub, messaging, state, patterns, and observability packages
3. **Design Core Interfaces**: Define the primary types and interfaces for each package
4. **Establish Integration Patterns**: Determine how orchestration primitives integrate with go-agents agents
5. **Plan Development Phases**: Break down implementation into manageable phases
6. **Document Design Decisions**: Capture architectural choices and rationale

### Planning Deliverables

Create the following documents in the go-agents-orchestration repository:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical specifications, interface definitions, design patterns
2. **PROJECT.md**: Project scope, development roadmap, key questions, validation criteria
3. **README.md**: Package overview, installation, quick start examples
4. **_context/design-decisions.md**: Detailed design decisions, trade-offs, and rationale

## Development Philosophy

### From go-agents Design Principles

Apply these principles from the parent library:

1. **Minimal Abstractions**: Provide only essential primitives for agent coordination
2. **Format Extensibility**: Enable new patterns without modifying core code
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Compose workflows through declarative configuration where appropriate
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's type system for compile-time safety
5. **Go-Native Patterns**: Embrace Go concurrency idioms rather than porting Python patterns

### Testing Strategy

Follow go-agents testing approach:

- Black-box testing with `package_test` suffix
- Table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- 80%+ code coverage requirement
- Focus on public API validation

### Package Lifecycle

This is the first supplemental package and serves as a template for future packages:

- Pre-release versioning (v0.x.x)
- Breaking changes allowed during pre-release
- Validate go-agents API through real-world usage
- Provide feedback to go-agents for API improvements
- Graduate to v1.0.0 after validation period

## Success Criteria

The go-agents-orchestration package is successful when:

1. **API Validation**: Successfully exercises go-agents public API, identifying any friction points or missing capabilities
2. **Pattern Completeness**: Implements sequential, parallel, conditional, and stateful workflow patterns
3. **Hub Coordination**: Demonstrates multi-hub coordination with cross-hub messaging
4. **Observability**: Provides production-grade observability without performance degradation
5. **Go-Native Design**: Leverages Go concurrency primitives in ways that feel natural to Go developers
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples for all patterns
7. **Test Coverage**: Achieves 80%+ test coverage with black-box testing approach

## Getting Started

1. Create go-agents-orchestration repository
2. Initialize Go module: `go mod init github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents-orchestration`
3. Add dependency: `go get github.com/JaimeStill/go-agents@v0.1.0`
4. Review go-agents-research hub implementation
5. Begin planning phase by creating ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT.md
6. Design core interfaces and package structure
7. Document design decisions and architectural trade-offs

## Questions for Planning Phase

1. Should hub be the primary coordination primitive, or should we have higher-level orchestration abstractions?
2. How should agents be registered with hubs? Direct registration vs. configuration-driven?
3. What is the relationship between state graphs and hub messaging?
4. Should workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, etc.) be separate from state management?
5. How should observability be captured without tight coupling to workflow execution?
6. What configuration structures are needed for orchestration setup?
7. How should errors propagate through multi-agent workflows?
8. What lifecycle hooks are needed for workflow initialization and cleanup?
